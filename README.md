# IncidentManager
Controls the creation and modification of ManagedIncidentLists. Implements the Singleton design pattern, meaning only one instance of IncidentManager can ever be created. This ensures that all parts of the IncidentManagerGUI are interacting with the same IncidentManager at all times.
